IMPORTANT NOTE!

The following licence covers only the code developed by the DFTB+ developers.
Source code placed in the ext_* directories are from external sources and have
separate licenses, which can be found in those directories.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Preamble*

In the following the term "authors" refers to Thomas Frauenheim, Bálint Aradi
and Ben Hourahine. The term "program" shall mean the copyrighted DFTB+ package
(in source, object and executable form).

This licence covers the use of DFTB+ for non-commercial purposes, other uses may
be arranged individually by discussion with the authors.


*Mandatory terms and conditions*

I request a copy of the DFTB+ package and therefore agree to the following terms
and conditions to use the program and to have access to the source code:

1. All title, ownership and rights to the program or to any copies of it remain
   with the authors, regardless of the ownership of the media on which the
   program is used or installed.

2. I will not provide a copy of the program in any way to anyone for any reason
   whatsoever. I may make copies of the code but only for backup purposes, or to
   use it on any of my group's computer resources.  I will refer any request for
   copies of the program to the authors.  Anyone directly associated with my
   research group is covered by the licence and may share my copy of the program
   on all of my group's computer resources as long as they agree to the
   mandatory terms and conditions.

3. I will not incorporate any part of the program into any other computer code
   or program system without written permission of the authors.

4. The program and any documentation is supplied on an as is basis without any
   warranty, and thus with no additional responsibility or liability. I
   understand that support for running the program can not be provided in
   general, except on the basis of a joint project between the code authors and
   the research partner.

5. It is obvious that modifications of the program can lead to problems where
   the authors may not be able to help. It is encouraged that I report any
   difficulties encountered in the use of standard versions of the program,
   which I have not modified, to the authors.

6. Users are encouraged to report usefull modifications to programs to the
   authors. I agree that any reported modifications could be incorporated into
   the program, potentially with further modifications. I certify that I am
   entitled to, and bear responsibility for contributing these modifications to
   the program and that they will be covered by this licence once
   incorporated. The contributed modifications are non-exclusively for use in
   the program, so that my rights to use the original modifications I have
   contributed for other purposes are not affected.

7. In any publication derived from use of the program, I will make references to
   relevant papers about the program (DFTB+), the DFTB (Density Functional based
   Tight Binding) method and any appropriate extensions used. The manual of the
   program contains the list of the papers to consider for citation.

8. One copy of each and every publication resulting from use of the program will
   be sent to the contact address of the authors for their attention.

9. DFTB+ relies on external libraries for operation. Some of those libraries are
   included in the DFTB+ distribution. The terms and conditions for the
   redistribution of these libraries are given in the appropriate source
   directories.
