# ifort-8.x preprocessor/compiler bug workaround.
#
# Issue:
#	The compiler does not recognise the call keyword when immediately
#	followed by a line continuation symbol, as in "call&".
#	Also applies when the "call" keyword itself is broken across lines.
#
# Workaround:
#	Break line before critical location.
#
# Caveat:
#	Does not attempt to stay away from comments or strings.
