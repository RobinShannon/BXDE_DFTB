In this directory we have some makefiles which were working at some point. We do
not have access to those plattforms/compilers any more, so they are not
maintained. You could, however, find a few ideas for your plattform, if it is
not among the supported ones. But DO NOT USE THEM directly as templates, use
make.generic in the parent directory instead.
